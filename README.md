This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

# Deployment 

Ensure that you sanitize the build first by running `npm run build`. Confirm that there are no errors there before comitting and pushing code to repo.

The changes should then be present under www.yangantiques.com
